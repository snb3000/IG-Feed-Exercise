HTML Hello
The most basic boilerplate for any 4Geeks Academy student, start your very first website from scratch.

There is a video tutorial on how to use this template to create your very first website here.

What to do next?
Create an index.html file with the basic HTML structure and see it live by running a web-server using the following command:

$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
You can create as many HTML files as you want.
You can also create CSS files and import them into your website using a <link> tag placed between the <head></head> tags, like this:
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
